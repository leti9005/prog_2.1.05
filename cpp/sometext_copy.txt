Philosophy as a sphere of culture and one of the main forms of development of the human spirit has existed for more than two and a half millennia. Its genesis as a relatively independent form of social consciousness took place in the conditions of the formation of ancient civilizations in the period VIII-VI centuries BC in countries such as India, China, Egypt. Subsequent development philosophy in ancient Greece and Rome was marked by the crystallization of theoretical thinking, capable of setting and solving extremely general and fundamental questions of the being of nature, society and man. Philosophy arises and develops from the needs of people in a generalized and holistic understanding of the world, comprehension of it on the basis of the principles of reason and data of public practice.
